# OpenAI Python Library

The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API
from applications written in the Python language. It includes a
pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize
themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible
with a wide range of versions of the OpenAI API.

## Documentation

See the [OpenAI API docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference?lang=python).

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade openai
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available on the [website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). Either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

Or set `openai.api_key` to its value:

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."

# list engines
engines = openai.Engine.list()

# print the first engine's id
print(engines.data[0].id)

# create a completion
completion = openai.Completion.create(engine="ada", prompt="Hello world")

# print the completion
print(completion.choices[0].text)
```

### Params
All endpoints have a `.create` method that support a `request_timeout` param.  This param takes a `Union[float, Tuple[float, float]]` and will raise a `openai.error.TimeoutError` error if the request exceeds that time in seconds (See: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#timeouts).

## Image generation (DALLÂ·E)

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."  # supply your API key however you choose

image_resp = openai.Image.create(prompt="two dogs playing chess, oil painting", n=4, size="512x512")

```

See the [usage guide](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/images) for more details.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7.1+

In general, we want to support the versions of Python that our customers are using. If you run into problems with any version issues, please let us know at support@openai.com.
